## Brastlewark with Hooks

This is a improvement of [brastlewark gnomes](https://github.com/franlol/brastlewark-gnomes) application with Hooks.

<br>

This is what i used:

- Sharing global state with **useContext**.

- Updating global state with **useReducer**.

- Internal component states with **useState**.

- Lifecycle handled with **useEffect**.

- Custom hook **useFetch** to fetch data and know the state (loaded, error...)
